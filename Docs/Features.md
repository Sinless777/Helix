| Theme                     | Focus                                                                          | Linked Issues                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication & Identity | Establish shared auth service, session payloads, and multi-provider linking.   | [#151](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/151), [#152](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/152) |
| Context Intelligence      | Build the context engine that fuses memory, telemetry, and retention controls. | [#153](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/153)                                                         |
| Security & Policy         | Deliver zero-trust policy evaluation and signed audit logging.                 | [#154](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/154)                                                         |
| Plugin Ecosystem          | Stand up the sandbox runtime and lifecycle management for third-party skills.  | [#155](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/155)                                                         |
| Developer Surface         | Ship the TypeScript SDK and CLI to expose Helix capabilities programmatically. | [#156](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/156), [#157](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/157) |

### Delivery Checklist

- Auth flows and account linking documented with environment setup for contributors (issues [#151](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/151) and [#152](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/152)).
- Context engine contracts reviewed by AI and platform teams prior to SDK wiring (issue [#153](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/153)).
- Security engine test harness and audit pipelines validated before plugin runtime launch (issue [#154](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/154)).
- Plugin runtime, SDK, and CLI roadmaps remain in lockstep so developer tooling reflects the same permission model (issues [#155](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/155), [#156](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/156), and [#157](https://github.com/Sinless777/Helix/issues/157)).

> Keeping these threads synchronized ensures GA customers receive a coherent experience across authentication, policy enforcement, and developer tooling.
