     func main() {
         profiler.Start(
             profiler.Config{
                 ApplicationName: "my-app",
                 ServerAddress:   "http://pyroscope-server:4040",
             },
         )
         // Your application logic here
     }
     ```

2. **Configuring Profiling Options:**
   - Adjust settings such as sampling rates, profiling types (CPU, memory, goroutine), and retention policies in the Pyroscope configuration file.
3. **Data Source Setup in Grafana:**
   - Add Pyroscope as a data source in Grafana using its HTTP API endpoints.
   - Customize the connection parameters, such as the server URL and authentication (if required).

### Dashboard Provisioning and Data Visualization

1. **Automated Dashboard Provisioning:**

   - Use JSON or YAML configuration files to provision Grafana dashboards that include panels for profiling data.
   - Example (YAML configuration):

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: 1
     providers:
       - name: 'profiling'
         orgId: 1
         folder: 'Performance'
         type: file
         disableDeletion: false
         editable: true
         options:
           path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/pyroscope
     ```

2. **Creating Custom Panels:**
   - Design panels to display key metrics such as CPU flame graphs, memory allocation trends, and request latency breakdowns.
   - Leverage Grafana’s query language to refine the data displayed from Pyroscope.
3. **Integrating with Other Observability Data:**
   - Combine profiling data with system metrics and logs in a single dashboard to enable cross-correlation.
   - Set up alerts based on profiling anomalies to trigger notifications or automated remediation workflows.
