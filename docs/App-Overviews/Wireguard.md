## Integration Details

In this section, we dive into the specifics of how Wireguard VPN is configured and integrated within our network architecture. The following details cover everything from initial setup to advanced configuration options.

### Configuration Examples

Below are several examples that illustrate how Wireguard can be configured for various use cases.

#### Basic Peer-to-Peer Setup

This example demonstrates a simple peer-to-peer configuration between two endpoints. Save the configuration as `wg0.conf` on both devices, making sure to exchange public keys securely.

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = <PEER_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
Endpoint = peer.example.com:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

Repeat the process for the second endpoint with the roles reversed. This configuration creates a secure tunnel with persistent keepalive messages to maintain the connection even when behind NAT.

#### Multi-Peer Configuration

For scenarios involving more than two endpoints, the configuration expands to include multiple peers. This setup is commonly used in hub-and-spoke architectures where a central server connects to many clients.

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = <CLIENT1_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = <CLIENT2_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = <CLIENT3_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.4/32
```

Each client device should be configured similarly, ensuring that the central server is added as a peer on each client’s configuration file.

#### Advanced Routing Configuration

In more complex deployments, routing traffic through Wireguard may require advanced configuration options. For example, if you need to route all traffic from a remote endpoint through the VPN, adjust the AllowedIPs parameter:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY>
Address = 10.0.0.10/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = <SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY>
Endpoint = server.example.com:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

This setting directs all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic through the secure tunnel, ensuring that every packet is encrypted and routed via the VPN.

     wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
     ```

   - Securely exchange public keys between devices.

3. **Configuration File Creation:**
   - Create a configuration file (e.g., `wg0.conf`) for each device using the examples provided above.
   - Ensure the `AllowedIPs` and `Endpoint` fields are correctly configured to match your network topology.

4. **Starting the Service:**
   - Enable and start the Wireguard service:

     ```bash
     sudo wg-quick up wg0
     ```

   - To stop the service, use:

     ```bash
     sudo wg-quick down wg0
     ```

5. **Testing the Connection:**
   - Verify the tunnel is active by checking the interface status:

     ```bash
     sudo wg show
     ```

   - Test connectivity by pinging the remote endpoint.

6. **Firewall and NAT Configuration:**
   - Adjust your firewall settings to allow UDP traffic on the Wireguard port (default is 51820).
   - If behind NAT, ensure port forwarding is configured appropriately.
