## How Grafana Beyla is Used in the Architecture

Grafana Beyla is integrated as a core component of our observability stack, playing a critical role in the monitoring, alerting, and operational management of modern, distributed systems.

### Unified Observability and Control

Beyla consolidates data from multiple observability layers—metrics, logs, and traces—into a single pane of glass. This consolidation:

- **Facilitates Rapid Diagnosis:** Correlates different types of data to pinpoint the root cause of performance issues.
- **Enhances Decision Making:** Provides comprehensive insights that allow operational teams to quickly assess the state of their systems and take appropriate action.
- **Automates Response:** Integrates with automated remediation systems to reduce the mean time to recovery (MTTR) during incidents.

### Integration with the Grafana Ecosystem

As part of the Grafana suite, Beyla is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Grafana Cloud services:

- **Native Dashboard Integration:** Leverages Grafana’s powerful dashboarding capabilities, allowing users to create custom visualizations that combine Beyla’s data with other Grafana data sources.
- **Alerting and Notification:** Works in conjunction with Prometheus Alert Manager and other notification systems to ensure that alerts are delivered promptly and accurately.
- **Data Federation:** Supports data federation across multiple clusters and environments, providing a unified view of system performance regardless of scale or complexity.

## Integration Details

Integrating Grafana Beyla into your environment involves several key steps, from installation and configuration to provisioning dashboards and fine-tuning data flows.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Deployment Options:**
   - **Docker:** Deploy Grafana Beyla using Docker containers for quick and isolated setups.

     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 4000:4000 --name=grafana-beyla grafana/beyla:latest
     ```

   - **Kubernetes:** Use Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests for orchestration in a cluster environment.
   - **Standalone Installation:** Install via pre-built binaries for traditional server setups.

2. **Initial Configuration:**
   - Configure the primary settings such as data sources, retention policies, and authentication mechanisms.
   - Create a configuration file (e.g., `beyla-config.yaml`) that includes necessary environment variables and parameters for your specific deployment.

### Configuration and Customization

1. **Data Source Configuration:**
   - Integrate with existing data sources such as Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo to consolidate observability data.
   - Configure API endpoints and access tokens as required by your security policies.

2. **Dashboard Provisioning:**
   - Use Grafana’s dashboard provisioning capabilities to automate the deployment of Beyla-specific dashboards.
   - Example YAML snippet:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: 1
     providers:
       - name: 'beyla_dashboards'
         orgId: 1
         folder: 'Observability'
         type: file
         disableDeletion: false
         editable: true
         options:
           path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/beyla
     ```

3. **Custom Templates and Alerts:**
   - Customize alert templates and dashboard panels using Go templating to include specific metrics and remediation instructions.
   - Configure alerting rules within Prometheus Alert Manager to work in tandem with Beyla’s automated workflows.

### Provisioning and Data Flow

- **Data Collection:** Beyla collects data continuously from connected sources, normalizing and processing it for real-time analysis.
- **Processing Pipeline:** The system uses a modular pipeline to filter, aggregate, and enrich data before it is stored and visualized.
- **Visualization:** Processed data is rendered into interactive Grafana dashboards, where users can drill down into performance metrics, view historical trends, and identify anomalies.
