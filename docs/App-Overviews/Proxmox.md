## How Proxmox is Used in the Architecture

Proxmox plays a critical role in our infrastructure as our primary hypervisor. It provides the foundation for running virtual machines and containers, enabling efficient resource utilization and flexible deployment of services.

### Role as a Hypervisor

Proxmox is the backbone of our virtualization strategy:

- **Consolidation:** Allows us to consolidate multiple virtual machines on a single physical server.
- **Resource Optimization:** Maximizes hardware utilization while ensuring isolation and security between virtual environments.
- **Flexibility:** Supports a wide range of operating systems and configurations, making it ideal for diverse workloads.

### Virtualization and Containerization

Using both KVM and LXC, Proxmox offers:

- **Full Virtual Machines:** For scenarios requiring complete OS isolation or different operating systems.
- **Containers:** For lightweight, high-performance applications that share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead and improving efficiency.

This dual capability enables us to optimize performance based on the specific needs of each workload while maintaining a consistent management experience.

## Integration Details

Integrating Proxmox into our infrastructure involves careful planning and configuration to ensure that the hypervisor runs efficiently and reliably.

### Deployment and Setup

1. **Hardware and Network Configuration:**
   - Select servers with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage resources.
   - Configure networking for high availability and redundancy.
2. **Installation:**
   - Install Proxmox VE using the official ISO image.
   - Follow the guided installation process to set up the host system.
3. **Initial Configuration:**
   - Configure basic settings such as hostname, network interfaces, and storage options.
   - Set up a cluster if multiple Proxmox nodes are used to provide high availability.

### Configuration and Management

1. **Virtual Machine and Container Provisioning:**
   - Use the web interface to create and configure virtual machines and containers.
   - Allocate resources and set up networking according to workload requirements.
2. **Storage Management:**
   - Configure storage pools and integrate various storage backends.
   - Implement backup strategies and snapshot management for disaster recovery.
3. **User and Role Management:**
   - Define user roles and permissions to control access to the Proxmox environment.
   - Utilize two-factor authentication and other security measures to protect the hypervisor.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Performance Monitoring:** Use built-in tools and integrations (e.g., with Grafana) to monitor CPU, memory, and network performance.
- **Log Aggregation:** Collect and analyze logs from Proxmox nodes for troubleshooting and audit purposes.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep the Proxmox software and underlying OS updated with the latest security patches and feature improvements.
