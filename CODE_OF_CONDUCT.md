# Helix AI Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the maintainers and contributors of Helix AI, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to building a collaborative platform where ideas from all backgrounds can thrive, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Positive behavior includes:

- Demonstrating empathy and respect for people with different viewpoints and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the product.
- Showing appreciation for effort, not just outcomes.
- Being mindful of how change proposals affect security, privacy, and safety for our users.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, intimidation, stalking, or sustained disruption of community spaces.
- Discriminatory jokes, slurs, or imagery.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Abuse of access credentials, secrets, or infrastructure owned by the project.
- Any conduct that violates applicable laws or the licenses that govern this repository.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing community standards. They have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces—GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, and events—as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or community (for example, the Helix Discord server, conference talks, or social media under the project’s name).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

- Emailing the maintainers at **[community@helixaibot.com](mailto:community@helixaibot.com)**
- Sending a direct message to the **@Maintainers** role in the [Helix Discord](https://discord.gg/Za8MVstYnr)
- Opening a confidential ticket via GitHub (for example, a newly created private issue referencing “Code of Conduct”)

All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly. The maintainers will respect the privacy and security of the reporter and will keep incident details limited to individuals with a legitimate need to know.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines when determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** – A private, written warning clarifying the violation and expectations for improvement.
2. **Warning** – A formal warning with potential temporary suspension from community spaces.
3. **Temporary Ban** – A time-limited ban from community channels, contribution activity, or both.
4. **Permanent Ban** – Removal from the community and revocation of contribution privileges, including the right to represent Helix AI publicly.

The maintainers may skip steps if the offense is severe (for example, threats, hate speech, or intentional data exfiltration).
